## How to Install and Run

1. **Install dependencies**  
   If you used Vite, you likely ran:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

3. **Run the tests**
   ```
   npm test
   ```
   or (if using Vitest directly)
   ```
   npx vitest
   ```

## Notes

- If you are not sure how you installed Vite, check your `package.json` for `"vite"` under `devDependencies`.
- If you need to install Vite globally (not usually required), you can run:
  ```
  npm install -g vite
  ```
- Most projects work with just `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
